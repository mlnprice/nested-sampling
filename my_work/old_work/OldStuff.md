These are a couple of old notebooks from when I first started the group.

Lennard-Jones_Practice was when I was figuring out how to make good molecular dynamics simulations.

Nested_Sampling_Practice is a precursor to the NestedSampling notebook. It's similar, but it's on an older version of Julia.
