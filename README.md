# Nested Sampling
A simple look at nested sampling using MD in 2 dimensions.


In this group we write most of our code in python, if we need it to be faster then we prototype it in python and then 
Phase diagrams are important! It sure would be cool if we could make good pahse diagrams using computers.
Nested sampling holds promise because it has an easier time dealing with phase transitions than some other
computational methods, but is not to complicated to use. The main goal of this guide is to help you get a
more intuitive understanding of the nested sampling algoritm. Along the way, you'll learn about molecular
dynamics, the partition function, and the Julia coding language.
